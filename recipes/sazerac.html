    <h1>A Taste Of The Big Easy</h1>
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 sugar cube</li>
      <li>3 dashes Peychaud's Bitters</li>
      <li>2 oz rye whiskey, to taste</li>
      <li>.25 oz absinthe, or anise liqueur</li>
      <li>Lemon twist, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Chill an old-fashioned glass by filling it with ice. Let it sit while
        you prepare the rest of the drink.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing glass, soak the sugar cube with the bitters and muddle to
        crush the cube.
      </li>
      <li>Add the rye whiskey and stir.</li>
      <li>
        Discard the ice in the chilled glass. Rinse it with absinthe: Pour a
        small amount into the glass, swirl it around, then discard the liquid.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the whiskey mixture into the absinthe-rinsed glass.</li>
      <li>
        Gently squeeze the lemon twist over the drink to release its essence.
        Traditionalists typically discard it and rarely drop it into the glass;
        lay it on the rim as a garnish if you like. Serve and enjoy.
